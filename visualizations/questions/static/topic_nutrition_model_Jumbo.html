There are 20 different amino acids. Nine of these are called "essential amino acids" because the body cannot make them from other compounds. These essential amino acids must be obtained from food. Proteins are an important part of every cell in the body. They are used to make muscles, bones, skin, hair, and nails. They also help repair cells and tissues. Proteins help the body fight infection, and are an important part of the immune system. Proteins from animal sources, such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, milk, cheese, and yogurt, are called "complete proteins"</i></div><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: dietary protein excess problem ?</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: Is glutamine supplementation needed in catabolic patients?

Electrolytes are minerals that conduct electricity.  Keep Learning  When a muscle contracts, it releases electrolytes into the surrounding fluid. The electrolytes then conduct the electricity better than fat, which is more solid. Fat does not have electrolytes.  Muscles contract when the brain tells them to do so. The brain sends an electrical impulse through the nerves, which stimulates muscles to contract.

The resistance of the current. The conductivity of the medium.  Resistance is a measure of how difficult it is for charge carriers (in this case, electrons) to flow through a material. Conductivity is a measure of how easy it is for charge carriers to move through a material. Fat and muscle are materials.  Muscle is composed mostly of protein, which is highly conductive. Fat is composed of triglycerides, which are much less conductive.
