The bill, which is yet to be passed, proposes that the government should have the right to acquire and distribute food in case of a food emergency. It also proposes to create a National Food Security Authority to monitor the implementation of the bill.  The bill has been criticised by the opposition parties, which claim that the bill will further push up food prices.

The hydrogen atoms in HCl are bonded to chlorine atoms, while the deuterium atoms in DCl are bonded to chlorine atoms. The difference in bonding causes the infrared absorption frequency of DCl to be shifted from that of HCl.  The infrared absorption frequencies of molecules can also be shifted by changing the temperature. When the temperature is increased, the vibrational motion of the molecules increases. As a result, the frequency of the infrared absorption band shifts to a higher frequency.</i></div><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: why does the infrared absorption frequency of dci shift to hci</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: when the molecule is in the ground state?  Answer:  The infrared absorption frequency of a molecule is determined by the vibrational frequencies of the molecule. The vibrational frequencies depend on the potential energy curve of the molecule. The potential energy curve depends on the electronic configuration of the molecule, so the infrared absorption frequency depends on the electronic configuration.  If the molecule is in the ground state, the electronic configuration is 1s22s22p63s23p63d106</i></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>User Answer: A</div><br><hr><br><div class='question' style='background-color:#fca503'><b>QUESTION: Cobalt-60 is used in the radiation therapy of cancer and can be produced by bombardment of cobalt-59 with which of the following?</b><br>A: Neutrons<br>B: Alpha particles<br>C: Beta particles<br>D: X-rays<br></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>True Answer: A</div><br><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: Cobalt-60 is used in the radiation therapy of cancer and can be produced by bombardment of cobalt-59 with which of the following?</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: A.
