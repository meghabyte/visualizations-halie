Molecules absorb infrared light because of the vibrational motions they undergo while in the ground state. These vibrations are caused by collisions with other molecules, collisions with photons, and collisions with the walls of their container. The more collisions a molecule undergoes, the more likely it is to be in a higher vibrational state. The more likely it is to be in a higher vibrational state, the more likely it</i></div><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: What is atomic mass?</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: The atomic mass of an atom is the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of the atom.

For example, in a box full of gas, the molecules are moving around at random. The disorder is high. As the gas is heated, the molecules move faster and faster until they are all moving at the same speed. The disorder is lower.  The second law of thermodynamics says that in any closed system, entropy increases. That is, the disorder increases. In the previous example, the gas is a closed system</i></div><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: Does a spontaneous process increase entropy?</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: The second law of thermodynamics says that spontaneous processes increase the entropy of the universe. The word “spontaneous” is important — it means that the process happens without being forced by an external agent.  Spontaneous processes can be thought of as the natural state of affairs. The second law of thermodynamics says that the natural state of affairs is for entropy to increase.
