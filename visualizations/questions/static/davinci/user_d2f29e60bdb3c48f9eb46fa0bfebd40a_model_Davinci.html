Muscle is a more conductive tissue than fat.  How does bioelectrical impedance work?  Bioelectrical impedance uses a very small electrical current to measure the conductivity of the body. The electrical current is sent through two electrodes (small metal discs) that are placed on the wrist and ankle. The electrical current travels through the body and is measured at the wrist and ankle.
