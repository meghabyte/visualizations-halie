Endothermic reactions are spontaneous processes that require heat energy and absorb heat from the surroundings.  Exothermic and endothermic reactions can be described in terms of their enthalpy changes, which can be determined by using the enthalpy of the products and reactants.  The enthalpy change for the reaction can be calculated from the following equation:  ΔH rxn = ΔH</i></div><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: exothermic, entropy. what is always true of a spontaneous process.</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: the law of conservation of energy.  the law of conservation of energy. what is always true of a spontaneous process.  the law of conservation of energy. a spontaneous process is one that occurs without the addition of energy.  the law of conservation of energy. a spontaneous process is one that occurs without the addition of energy.  the law of conservation of energy. a spontaneous process is one that occurs without the addition of energy. a spontaneous process is one that occurs</i></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>User Answer: B</div><br><hr><br><div class='question' style='background-color:#fca503'><b>QUESTION: Peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations, entangling alliances with none'.
