The poll, conducted in April 1974, found that only 25 percent of Americans thought that Nixon should be removed from office.  That was before the release of the “smoking gun” tape in which Nixon told his chief of staff to tell the CIA to tell the FBI to stop the FBI’s investigation of the Watergate break-in.

Cook's claim was widely disbelieved at the time. He was made a scapegoat for the expedition's failure and was almost court-martialed. Cook was later vindicated by a Congressional investigation, but he never received the full recognition he deserved.
