When the current gets large enough, the current will move faster through muscle because muscle has a lower resistivity than fat.

In the case of the HCl molecule, the shifts are attributed to the lone pair of electrons on the chlorine atom. The chlorine lone pair is delocalized, and the negative charge associated with it is spread out over the entire molecule. This results in a net charge of zero. The positive charge of the hydrogen atoms is not spread out over the entire molecule and is therefore localized.
