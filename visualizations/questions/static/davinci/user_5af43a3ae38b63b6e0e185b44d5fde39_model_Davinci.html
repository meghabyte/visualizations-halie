Difference between DCI and HCI  DCI and HCI are two different types of computer architectures. The main difference between DCI and HCI is that DCI is a computer architecture used in supercomputers while HCI is a computer architecture used in personal computers.

The electron distribution is different in the two compounds. In deuterium chloride the distribution is uniform and in hydrogen chloride the distribution is not uniform.  Why is the electron distribution in deuterium chloride uniform?  The uniform electron distribution in deuterium chloride is because the deuterium atom is much heavier than the hydrogen atom and therefore the deuterium atom is much less likely to be removed from the molecule.

This is because HDL is the only lipoprotein that can accept cholesterol from peripheral tissues, and then return it to the liver for excretion. HDL also serves to transport triglycerides from the liver to peripheral tissues.  HDL has been shown to be protective against atherosclerosis, as well as heart disease.
