The reason for this is that the body  uses some of the protein you eat to  build new protein, and this leaves  less protein for building new bone.

The reaction does not require an input of energy from an external source.      A spontaneous reaction is a chemical reaction that occurs without the addition of energy. It is spontaneous because it does not require an input of energy from an external source. In other words, it is self-perpetuating.

If a process is spontaneous, then it is not caused by an external agent.  The first law of thermodynamics says that the change in the internal energy of a system is equal to the heat energy added to the system minus the work done by the system.  If the change in internal energy is zero, then the process is spontaneous.  The change in internal energy is zero when the heat energy added to the system is equal to</i></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>User Answer: B</div><br><hr><br><div class='question' style='background-color:#fca503'><b>QUESTION: On a global scale, trends are suggesting that with rising incomes and urbanization we are seeing a rise in which food commodities?</b><br>A: Roots and Tubers<br>B: Fruits and vegetables<br>C: Beans and lentils<br>D: Meat and Dairy products<br></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>True Answer: D</div><br><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: rising incomes and urbanization leads to a rise in certain foods</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: •  Fertilizers and pesticides are used to grow more food    •  Food is stored in refrigerators and freezers    •  Food is transported over long distances    •  Food is processed and packaged in factories    •  Food is preserved in cans, jars, and bottles    •  Food is irradiated to extend its shelf life    •  Food is genetically modified</i></div><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: rising incomes and urbanization leads to a rise in meat and dairy</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: consumption.
