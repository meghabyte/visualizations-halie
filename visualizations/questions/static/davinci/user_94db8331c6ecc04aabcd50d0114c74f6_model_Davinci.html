The nuclear charge of deuterium is twice that of hydrogen, and this difference in nuclear charge produces a corresponding difference in the forces between the electrons and nucleus of the atom. The greater the separation between the electron and the nucleus, the greater the frequency of infrared absorption. The frequency of absorption of a given wavelength of infrared light will also depend on the strength of the bonds between the atoms, as well as the energy of the electrons.
