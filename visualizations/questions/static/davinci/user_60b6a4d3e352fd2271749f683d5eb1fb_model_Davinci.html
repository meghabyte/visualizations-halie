In order to get an accurate reading, the bioelectrical impediance machine passes a small electrical current through the body. The amount of current passed through the body is very small, but it is enough to stimulate the body to conduct its own electricity.  The amount of electrical resistance the body offers is measured and used to calculate the amount</i></div><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: How is muscle different from fat?</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: Muscle is made up of cells called fibres, which are surrounded by connective tissue.
