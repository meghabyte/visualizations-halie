When a current travels through a muscle, it resistance is greater than when it travels through a fat. This is because muscle has more capillaries, which are small tubes that allow the passage of electricity.</i></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>User Answer: B</div><br><hr><br>USER: 7f3ade42b94a1648f4b88b99ee65b157<br><div class='question' style='background-color:#fca503'><b>QUESTION: What is the basic functional unit of skeletal muscle tissue?</b><br>A: the muscle fibre<br>B: the sarcomere<br>C: the myofibril<br>D: the sarcoplasmic reticulum<br></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>True Answer: B</div><br><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: What is the basic functional unit of skeletal muscle tissue?</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: The basic functional unit of skeletal muscle tissue is the muscle cell.</i></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>User Answer: B</div><br><hr><br>USER: f4e300f46b4f5ad55ae9d89b56fadda6<br><div class='question' style='background-color:#fca503'><b>QUESTION: When using bioelectrical impedance for measuring body composition, why does an electrical current travel faster through muscle than it does through fat?</b><br>A: Muscle contains less water than fat<br>B: Muscle contains more water than fat<br>C: Muscle weighs more than fat<br>D: Muscle weighs less than fat<br></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>True Answer: B</div><br><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: When using bioelectrical impedance for measuring body composition, why does an electrical current travel faster through muscle than it does through fat?</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: The electrical current travels faster through muscle than it does through fat because muscle is a more conductive material than fat.</i></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>User Answer: B</div><br><hr><br>USER: df98dca2a17957477fd262ca2106df34<br><div class='question' style='background-color:#fca503'><b>QUESTION: The supplementation of diet with which fat soluble vitamins has been shown to reduce cardiovascular disease?</b><br>A: Vitamin A and D<br>B: Vitamin A and K<br>C: Vitamin D and E<br>D: None of the above<br></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>True Answer: D</div><br><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: Which vitamins have been shown to reduce cardiovascular disease?</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: Some vitamins that have been shown to reduce cardiovascular disease include vitamin B12, vitamin C, and vitamin E.</i></div><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: Does vitamin D reduce cardiovascular disease?</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: There is no clear evidence that vitamin D reduces cardiovascular disease.
