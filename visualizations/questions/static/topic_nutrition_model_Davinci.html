Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a method of estimating body composition. Bioelectrical impedance is based on the fact that a small, harmless electrical current will travel more slowly through lean body mass (muscle, bone and water) than through fat. The speed at which the current travels is measured and converted into a body composition reading. The current is sent through the body via two electrodes (small pads) attached to the skin.

Muscle weighs more than fat. Muscle contains more water and protein than fat, which contains more fat and protein. The reason for this is that the electrical current is carried by sodium ions, which are slightly larger than potassium ions. The larger ions travel through the cell membranes more slowly than the smaller ones. Because of this, the electrical current travels more slowly through fat than through muscle.  3. Bioelectrical impedance analysis</i></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>User Answer: C</div><br><hr><br>USER: 86a041c6111a9db40aae6b575b22d9c6<br><div class='question' style='background-color:#fca503'><b>QUESTION: The supplementation of diet with which fat soluble vitamins has been shown to reduce cardiovascular disease?</b><br>A: Vitamin A and D<br>B: Vitamin A and K<br>C: Vitamin D and E<br>D: None of the above<br></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>True Answer: D</div><br><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: what fat soluble vitamins to reduce cardiovascular disease</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: risk in patients with diabetes mellitus.  how to reduce cardiovascular disease risk in patients with diabetes mellitus.  how to reduce cardiovascular disease risk in patients with diabetes mellitus.  how to reduce cardiovascular disease risk in patients with diabetes mellitus.  how to reduce cardiovascular disease risk in patients with diabetes mellitus.  how to reduce cardiovascular disease risk in patients with diabetes mellitus.  how to reduce cardiovascular disease risk in patients with diabetes mellitus.</i></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>User Answer: C</div><br><hr><br>USER: 9f2411c21cd11979bc6fd3df674a6db4<br><div class='question' style='background-color:#fca503'><b>QUESTION: Additional dietary protein may:</b><br>A: Increase risk of hip fracture<br>B: Decrease calcium excretion in the urine<br>C: Stimulate production of insulin-like growth hormone<br>D: Reduce muscle mass and strength<br></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>True Answer: C</div><br><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: additional dietary protein may</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: be necessary to maintain  nitrogen balance in the  absence of additional  dietary protein.
