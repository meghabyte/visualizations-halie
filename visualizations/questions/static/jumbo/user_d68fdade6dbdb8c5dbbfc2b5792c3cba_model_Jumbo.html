Proteins are large molecules made up of amino acids. There are 20 amino acids that our bodies need to function, 12 of which are considered “essential” because our bodies cannot make them.  The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. For an average 150-pound adult, this is 56 grams of protein per day.
