The electron distribution in acetic acid, HCOOH, has been investigated using density functional theory (DFT). The calculations were performed using the B3LYP functional. The calculated dissociation energy for acetic acid is 55 kcal mol-1, and the calculated bond dissociation enthalpy is 49 kcal mol-1. The results indicate that there is a substantial charge transfer from the hydrogen to the oxygen in the reaction.
