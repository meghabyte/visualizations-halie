The metal is used as a gamma-emitting source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). Cobalt-60 is the parent isotope of cobalt-62, which has a half-life of 2.6 million years. Cobalt-60 is of considerable importance in radiotherapy, where it is used as a radioactive tracer. Cobalt-60 is also used in industrial radiography and thickness gauging. It has been used as a source of gamma radiation in food irradiation. Cobalt-60 has 60 protons and 60</i></div><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: how does cobalt-59 turn into cobalt-60</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: Answers 1  Cobalt-59 is a radioactive isotope of cobalt which decays into cobalt-60.  Cobalt-60 is a radioactive isotope of cobalt.  Cobalt-59 decays into cobalt-60:  Cobalt-59 has a half-life of 5.2 years.  Cobalt-60 has a half-life of 5.27 years.  Cobalt-59 decays by beta decay, in which an electron is ejected from the nucleus:  Cobalt-59 has a mass of 59.9</i></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>User Answer: A</div><br><hr><br><div class='question' style='background-color:#fca503'><b>QUESTION: During what war did Francis Scott Key write the words to 'The Star-Spangled Banner'?</b><br>A: American Revolution<br>B: War of 1812<br>C: Civil War<br>D: World War I<br></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>True Answer: B</div><br><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: During what war did Francis Scott Key write the words to 'The Star-Spangled Banner'?</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: What is the name of the world's tallest building?
