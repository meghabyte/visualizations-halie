The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends vitamin D supplementation of 400 IU for adults and 800 IU for those over 70 years of age. However, the AHA does not recommend routine supplementation of vitamins A, E, or K. In 2013, a Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to support the use of vitamin supplementation for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. In 2016, a meta-analysis of clinical trials found that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease.</i></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>User Answer: D</div><br><hr><br><div class='question' style='background-color:#fca503'><b>QUESTION: Which of the following statements best illustrates active listening on the part of a second-grade teacher who is helping a student solve a personal problem?</b><br>A: I have gathered the facts, and I know what really happened.<br>B: I understand you, and I know what is best for you.<br>C: I believe you understood the class rules.<br>D: I respect you as a person with your own ideas and feelings.<br></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>True Answer: D</div><br><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: What can a second-grade teacher say to a student to show they are actively listening when trying to help them solve a personal problem?</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: What questions can a teacher ask a classroom of students to get them to think about their own learning?
