The etiology of CVD is multifactorial, with diet being one of the main underlying factors. Vitamins A and K are fat-soluble vitamins that play important roles in bone mineralization and blood clotting. More recently, these vitamins have also been shown to possess cardioprotective properties. Epidemiological studies have shown that high intake of vitamins A and K is associated with reduced risk of CVD. The biological mechanisms responsible for this association are complex and multi-factorial, but it is believed that vitamins A and K may protect against CVD by improving endothelial function, reducing oxidative stress, and</i></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>User Answer: B</div><br><hr>
