In Massachusetts, for example, the minimum wage is $8 per hour, but employers can pay their employees $9.25 per hour.

The absorption of light by proteins causes excitation of electrons from ground state to excited state. The electrons in excited state are unstable and tend to return to ground state. This return to ground state is termed as relaxation. The lifetime of electrons in excited state is in the order of pico seconds. The relaxation of electrons from excited state to ground state is nonradiative. The relaxation occurs by collision with surrounding molecules or atoms.
