The contraction of skeletal muscles (muscle contraction) is initiated by a nerve impulse that travels along the axon of a motor neuron and causes the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions. The calcium ions bind to troponin, which changes shape, allowing myosin heads to bind to the actin filaments. The myosin heads pull the actin filaments toward the center of the sarcomere, causing the sarcomere to shorten. The sarcomere shortens until the myosin heads detach from the actin filaments. The sarcomere then relaxes to its original length</i></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>User Answer: B</div><br><hr>
