The resistance of the current. The conductivity of the medium.  Resistance is a measure of how difficult it is for charge carriers (in this case, electrons) to flow through a material. Conductivity is a measure of how easy it is for charge carriers to move through a material. Fat and muscle are materials.  Muscle is composed mostly of protein, which is highly conductive. Fat is composed of triglycerides, which are much less conductive.  So, yes, muscle has higher conductivity than fat does.</i></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>User Answer: B</div><br><hr>
