HDL Cholesterol and Why Is It Important? High density lipoprotein or HDL, is considered the “good” cholesterol. HDL is often referred to as “good” cholesterol because it carries cholesterol from the arteries to the liver, where cholesterol is broken down and excreted from the body. High levels of HDL cholesterol have been shown to reduce the risk for heart disease. HDL cholesterol levels are influenced by several factors including age, smoking, gender, and genetics. HDL levels tend to decrease with age. Low HDL cholesterol levels may be a sign of an underlying medical condition such as kidney or liver disease.

The fission process in nuclear reactors produces a large amount of heat, which turns water into steam. The steam then turns turbines which produce electricity. This electricity powers the coolant pumps that cool the reactor. The coolant pumps are powerful, but they use electricity.    The coolant pumps use electricity, but they produce heat. That heat is transferred to the reactor, which heats up the coolant. The heated coolant then circulates through the reactor, transferring its heat to the fuel rods.
