Now, researchers from the University of Missouri School of Medicine have found that exposure to specific wavelengths of light may increase the risk of AMD.  The study, published in the journal Scientific Reports ("Blue light exposure increases risk of age-related macular degeneration"), found that exposure to light in the 415-455 nanometer range, in the blue-violet spectrum, significantly increases the risk of AMD.

Much of this radioactive material remains poorly secured and vulnerable to theft, diversion, and misuse.  The US and Russia still own the world's largest stockpiles of highly enriched uranium (HEU) – the kind that could fuel a nuclear weapon. The US has an estimated 5,000 metric tons of HEU, and Russia reportedly has</i></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>User Answer: D</div><br><hr>
