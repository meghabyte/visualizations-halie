How does muscle have more conductivity than fat? Muscle cells have a much higher concentration of electrolytes (ions). Electrolytes are atoms that carry electrical charges. Water molecules are polar. They have a positive end and a negative end. The positive end of a water molecule is attracted to other water molecules, and the negative end of a water molecule is attracted to other water molecules. When an electrical current is applied to a muscle cell, the positive end of the water molecule is attracted to the positive end of the cell.
