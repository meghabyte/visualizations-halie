However, this does not always happen. For example, some firms may lobby the government to impose tariffs on imported goods to protect their domestic market. This protectionism is usually counterproductive, so why do countries still persist with it? Countries have an incentive to use trade policy to protect domestic firms from foreign competition. If a country’s firms produce goods more efficiently than foreign firms, then the country should export goods.
