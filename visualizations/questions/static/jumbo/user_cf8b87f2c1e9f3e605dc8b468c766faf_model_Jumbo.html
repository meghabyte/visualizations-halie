A 2012 study from the Netherlands, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2012;96:1145-1153), examined the association between dietary intake of fat soluble vitamins and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Researchers followed 7,696 adults, aged 55 to 69 years, for an average of 8.5 years. Results showed that those who consumed the highest amount of fat soluble vitamins, including vitamins A, D, E, and K, had a 25% lower risk of CVD than those who consumed the least.
