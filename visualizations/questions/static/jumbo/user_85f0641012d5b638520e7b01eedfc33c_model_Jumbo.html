It was signed on December 8, 1987, and entered into force on June 5, 1991. The Moscow Treaty is a follow-up to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty), which was signed by U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987. The INF Treaty eliminated all nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of 500 to 5,500 kilometers</i></div><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: What does the Moscow Treaty on Strategic Offensive Reductions accomplish?</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: The Moscow Treaty on Strategic Offensive Reductions (SORT), signed by Presidents Obama and Medvedev in April 2010, commits both countries to reduce their deployed strategic warheads to 1,550 each, and 700 launchers to 800 each. The treaty does not, however, include limits on non-deployed strategic warheads and launchers. The treaty is of historic significance. It is the first arms control agreement to reduce nuclear weapons since 1991, when START I expired. It is also the first treaty that commits the United States and Russia to reduce their deployed strategic nuclear forces to a number</i></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>User Answer: B</div><br><hr><br><div class='question' style='background-color:#fca503'><b>QUESTION: All proteins absorb electromagnetic radiation of wavelength around 190 nm, which corresponds to a π → π* excitation in the protein molecule.
