A spontaneous process is always exothermic. A spontaneous process is a process which occurs by itself. A spontaneous process is always exothermic because heat is given out. The reverse process (the process which heats the substance up) is not spontaneous. A spontaneous process can also occur when a substance absorbs heat. The reverse process (the process which cools the substance down) is not spontaneous. A spontaneous process can also occur when a substance gives off heat.
