When protein is broken down, waste products called ketones are created. If these waste products aren’t eliminated, they can build up in the blood and form crystals that collect in the kidneys. Over time, these crystals can stick together and form stones. Answer: A hiatal hernia occurs when the upper part of the stomach pushes upward into the chest through a small opening in the diaphragm. This opening is called a hiatus. The diaphragm is the muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen. Answer: The colon is the part of the large intestine that propels stool through the intestines.

In December, the UN General Assembly voted 128 to 9 with 35 abstentions to condemn the United States for recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  The vote came at UN Ambassador Nikki Haley's request, after the U.S. vetoed a Security Council resolution that called on the U.S. to reverse its decision.  Haley also orchestrated the passage of a Security Council resolution condemning Hamas, which the U.S. had blocked.  TRENDING: Twitter issues ultimatum to N.Y.
