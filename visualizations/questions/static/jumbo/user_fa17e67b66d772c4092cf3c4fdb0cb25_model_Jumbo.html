Electrolytes are minerals that conduct electricity.  Keep Learning  When a muscle contracts, it releases electrolytes into the surrounding fluid. The electrolytes then conduct the electricity better than fat, which is more solid. Fat does not have electrolytes.  Muscles contract when the brain tells them to do so. The brain sends an electrical impulse through the nerves, which stimulates muscles to contract. When the brain sends the impulse, the electrolytes in the muscle</i></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>User Answer: B</div><br><hr><br><div class='question' style='background-color:#fca503'><b>QUESTION: Before Nixon resigned how many believed he should be removed from office?</b><br>A: 79%<br>B: 98%<br>C: 33%<br>D: 57%<br></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>True Answer: D</div><br><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: Before resigning, how many believed Nixon should be removed from office?</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: 2/27/70: Nixon announces he will resign.  9/23/70: The House Judiciary Committee begins formal impeachment hearings.  8/9/71: The Judiciary Committee votes 27-11 to recommend impeachment.  9/17/71: The full House votes 410-4 to impeach Nixon.  9/20/71: Nixon resigns.  1.7 million  1.8 million  2.5</i></div><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: How many believed Nixon should be removed from office?</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: (CROSSTALK)  HANNITY: But, Mark, Nixon, he --  (CROSSTALK)  HANNITY: -- was impeached.
